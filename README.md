# Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders

This repository contains implementations and examples of Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders are neural network architectures used for unsupervised learning of efficient representations of input data. They are commonly used for tasks such as data compression, denoising, anomaly detection, and generation of new data samples.

This project provides:

- **Autoencoder**: A basic implementation of an autoencoder trained on a dataset to reconstruct input samples.
  
- **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**: An implementation of a VAE, which extends the concept of autoencoders by learning a probability distribution over latent variables. This allows for the generation of new data samples by sampling from the learned distribution.
